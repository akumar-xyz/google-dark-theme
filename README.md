Dark Theme for Google.
To install it you need extension for your browser called 'Stylus'.
If you are using Opera or Opera GX you also need 'Install Chrome Extensions', then you install it from Chrome Web Store.
Then simply you click on the Stylus icon in the right top corner, click on google.com and paste the .css.

Or fuck doing it manually and install it from UserStyles.world: https://userstyles.world/style/212/google-dark-theme
